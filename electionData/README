The files in this directory were downloaded from the State of Ohio Election Results webpage

   I found them by starting from the main web page, https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/election-results-and-data/, clicking on each
year individually and downloading the "local Issues Results (XLSX)" link for each election. Some files include the
date of the election. Others do not - in those cases, I renamed the files to include the date of the election. Some of the
excel files have the useful header informaion in the second row, others have it in the first row. See studyAllSchoolLevies.R for details.

   I found excel files for all primary (Mar or May) and November elections dating back to 2013. I also found some August elections, though 
not all of them. Some counties have Sept or Oct elections, I did not try to collect those. 

Here are the files for 2020:
